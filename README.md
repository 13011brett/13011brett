### Welcome in!

Current support technician, making leaps and bounds to become a software developer, full time.

I’m currently learning many different languages and frameworks at the moment, with my current focus being PHP / Laravel & Next.JS.

On a long-term basis, I plan to work on public-facing repositories on a consistent term.

Goal: 1 commit / code change every day for AT LEAST a year.
